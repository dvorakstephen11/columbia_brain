# GETTING_STARTED.md


AI:
```
Below are three sane, modern “full-stack + DevOps” options that center on Python and GitHub. They’re ordered from simplest to most flexible. I’ll also give you a tiny, working starter you can ship today.

---

## Quick decision guide

* **Start here if you’ve never shipped a site:** **Option A (PaaS: Render/Railway + FastAPI + Postgres)**
  Lowest ops burden. Push to GitHub, it builds and deploys. Easy rollback. Good for an MVP and the first year.

* **Go here if you want nearly zero server management at scale:** **Option B (AWS Serverless: Lambda + API Gateway + S3/CloudFront + DynamoDB or Aurora Serverless)**
  Scales well, fine-grained cost control, but more AWS concepts to learn.

* **Choose this if you want container control without Kubernetes complexity, and you know some Azure:** **Option C (Azure Container Apps + Postgres Flexible Server)**
  Clean GitHub Actions story with OIDC. Easy path to enterprise-grade practices later.

---

## Key ideas (plain language)

* **CI/CD:** automated checks (“CI”) run on every push; if they pass on your main branch, a deploy (“CD”) runs.
* **PaaS:** a platform that runs your app and database for you (you bring code, they handle servers).
* **Serverless:** you ship functions and static assets; the cloud runs them on-demand.
* **Containers:** you bundle your app into a standard image; the platform runs that image.
* **IaC:** infrastructure as code; your cloud resources are declared in files and reproducible.
* **OIDC to cloud from GitHub:** short-lived credentials during CI/CD; no long-lived secrets.

Mentally picture the flow: **Code push -> GitHub Actions runs tests -> platform deploys -> health check passes -> logs/metrics show green.**

---

## Option A (recommended to start): Render or Railway PaaS

**Stack**

* Frontend: server-rendered HTML with FastAPI + Jinja (optionally HTMX for interactivity)
* Backend: Python (FastAPI, Uvicorn)
* DB: Managed Postgres
* Hosting: Render or Railway (region close to your users)
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions for tests; platform auto-deploys on push; optional deploy hook
* Observability: platform logs; add Sentry later; simple `/healthz` endpoint

**Pros:** Easiest to ship; SSL, TLS, and scaling are handled.
**Cons:** Some vendor lock-in; less control over networking fine-tuning.

### Minimal, shippable starter (copy these files)

This is intentionally small and production-sane for a first release.

**app/main.py**

```python
import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse, PlainTextResponse
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

app = FastAPI()
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")

db_url = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///./dev.db")
engine = create_engine(db_url, pool_pre_ping=True)

@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def index(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("index.html", {"request": request})

@app.get("/time", response_class=PlainTextResponse)
def time():
    import datetime as dt
    return dt.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

@app.get("/healthz", response_class=PlainTextResponse)
def healthz():
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
    return "ok"
```

**templates/index.html**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>FastAPI Starter</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.12"></script>
  </head>
  <body style="max-width:42rem;margin:2rem auto;font-family:system-ui,sans-serif;">
    <h1>Hello, world</h1>
    <button hx-get="/time" hx-swap="outerHTML">Get UTC time</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

**requirements.txt**

```
fastapi==0.115.0
uvicorn==0.30.6
jinja2==3.1.4
sqlalchemy==2.0.36
psycopg[binary]==3.2.1
pytest==8.3.2
httpx==0.27.2
```

**tests/test_smoke.py**

```python
from starlette.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

def test_healthz():
    c = TestClient(app)
    r = c.get("/healthz")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.text == "ok"
```

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/pip
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pytest -q
```

**render.yaml** (Render “Blueprint” that defines app + database)

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: fastapi-web
    env: python
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    healthCheckPath: /healthz
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: app-db
          property: connectionString
databases:
  - name: app-db
    plan: starter
```

**Optional: trigger deploy from CI (instead of auto-deploy)**
Create another workflow and set `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` secret from Render.

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**

```yaml
name: deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -sS -X POST "${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}"
```

**Local run**

```
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Ship it**

1. Create a new GitHub repo.
2. Push these files.
3. In Render: “New +” -> “Blueprint” -> pick your repo with `render.yaml`.
4. Set a Postgres region near your users.
5. Merge to main. CI runs, then Render deploys.
6. Hit the URL, test `/healthz`.

---

## Option B: AWS Serverless (Lambda + API Gateway)

**Stack**

* Frontend: S3 static site + CloudFront CDN (or use your FastAPI templates if you prefer server-rendered pages)
* Backend: API Gateway -> Lambda (Python)
* DB: DynamoDB (simple) or Aurora Serverless v2 Postgres (SQL)
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions with OIDC to AWS; deploy via AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework
* Observability: CloudWatch logs/metrics; add X-Ray tracing later

**Pros:** Scales to zero, global CDN, fine-grained costs.
**Cons:** More moving parts and AWS concepts.

**Tiny Lambda example**

`handler.py`

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {"statusCode": 200, "headers": {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}, "body": "ok"}
```

`template.yaml` (AWS SAM)

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
  ApiFn:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: handler.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.12
      MemorySize: 256
      Timeout: 10
      Events:
        Http:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /healthz
            Method: get
Outputs:
  ApiUrl:
    Value: !Sub "https://${ServerlessRestApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod"
```

**GitHub Actions (deploy with SAM)**

```yaml
name: deploy-aws
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:role/<github-oidc-deploy-role>
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - uses: aws-actions/setup-sam@v2
      - run: sam build
      - run: sam deploy --stack-name serverless-app --no-confirm-changeset --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

**First publish**

1. Create an OIDC deploy role in IAM.
2. Put `handler.py` and `template.yaml` in a repo.
3. Add the workflow above and push to main.
4. SAM prints the API URL; hit `/healthz`.

---

## Option C: Azure Container Apps (serverless containers)

**Stack**

* Frontend: same FastAPI + Jinja or a separate static site on Azure Static Web Apps
* Backend: Containerized FastAPI on Azure Container Apps
* DB: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions with Azure OIDC; build and push container to ACR; `az containerapp up`
* Observability: Log Analytics workspace; Container Apps diagnostics

**Pros:** Clean GitHub integration, zero VM management, good middle ground.
**Cons:** A bit more setup than a pure PaaS.

**Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV PORT=8080
CMD ["uvicorn","app.main:app","--host","0.0.0.0","--port","8080"]
```

**GitHub Actions (build, push, deploy)**

```yaml
name: deploy-azure-aca
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: rg-web
      AZURE_REGION: eastus
      ACA_ENV: web-env
      ACA_APP: fastapi-app
      ACR_NAME: myacr1234
      IMAGE_NAME: fastapi
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
      - uses: azure/CLI@v1
        with:
          inlineScript: |
            az acr create -g $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $ACR_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled true || true
            ACR_LOGIN=$(az acr login -n $ACR_NAME --expose-token --output tsv --query accessToken)
            echo $ACR_LOGIN | docker login $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io -u 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --password-stdin
            docker build -t $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/$IMAGE_NAME:latest .
            docker push $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
            az containerapp env create -g $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $ACA_ENV -l $AZURE_REGION || true
            az containerapp up -g $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $ACA_APP -i $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/$IMAGE_NAME:latest --ingress external --target-port 8080 --environment $ACA_ENV --env-vars DATABASE_URL=replace_me
```

---

## How these relate and how to level up

* **Same app code, different runtimes.** FastAPI works on all three. You can start on PaaS and move to containers or serverless later.
* **Same CI patterns.** Lint, test, build, deploy. Only the deploy step changes per platform.
* **Secrets and config.** Always keep secrets out of code. Use platform secrets or cloud key vaults. Use `DATABASE_URL` across all options so your app code stays identical.
* **Observability baseline.** Always add `/healthz`, structured logs to stdout, and a basic uptime check. Add Sentry when you care about error triage. Add metrics later.

---

## What I would do in your shoes (first website ever)

1. Use **Option A (Render)** exactly as shown, ship in an hour.
2. Add a real Postgres migration tool (Alembic) once you store data.
3. Add Sentry when users arrive.
4. When you need more control, fork the same app to **Option C (Azure Container Apps)** or **Option B (AWS Serverless)**.

If you want, tell me which option you’re choosing and I’ll tailor the repo structure, environment setup, and a first feature (auth or a small CRUD) around it.

```


ME:
```
Let's lock in plan A. I have some questions to grant me clarity.

1) what's Render? How does it work? How much does it cost?

2) I already own a domain called positivesumtechnologies.com. Will I use this at all?

3) What is Alembic and why is it useful?

4) What is Sentry, how does it compare to alternative tools for the same purpose or similar purposes?

5) Can I use GitHub to store my secrets?

6) How should I set up my local environment for development? What's the fastest pipeline for making a new feature and pushing it up through CI/CD to see the changes reflected in my public website?

7) I want this website to support my Columbia Brain project. We've discussed this project at length before. Does anything about this starter structure change if you know I'm using the website for that purpose? 

8) How do I make this secure from the very start? 

9) How can I monitor traffic to my website?
```

AI:
```
Locked in on **Plan A (Render + FastAPI + Postgres)**. I’ll answer each question plainly, with exactly what to do first and why.

---

## 1) What is Render? How does it work? How much does it cost?

**What it is:** Render is a “platform‑as‑a‑service” (PaaS). You connect your GitHub repo; Render builds your app on every push and runs it for you (HTTPS, scaling, logs, metrics, deploy history). It supports Python (FastAPI/Django), static sites, cron jobs, background workers, managed Postgres, and a Redis‑compatible Key Value store. ([Render][1])

**How it works (for you):**

1. Create a **Web Service** from your repo (branch `main` by default).
2. Render detects Python, runs your build command (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`), and starts `uvicorn`.
3. On future pushes to `main`, Render rebuilds and redeploys automatically (or only **after CI checks pass**, if you enable that). You can also trigger deploys from CI via **Deploy Hooks**. ([Render][2])

**Costs (as of Sep 2025):**

* **Workspace plan**: *Hobby $0/user/mo*, *Professional $19/user/mo*, *Organization $29/user/mo* (plus compute). Hobby includes 100 GB/mo bandwidth; Pro includes 500 GB. ([Render][3])
* **Web Service instances**: Starter $7/mo (512 MB RAM, 0.5 CPU), Standard $25/mo (2 GB, 1 CPU), up through larger tiers. ([Render][3])
* **Managed Postgres**: Basic‑256MB $6/mo, Basic‑1GB $19/mo, etc. Storage $0.30/GB‑mo. There’s also a 30‑day free tier (not for prod). ([Render][3])
* **Bandwidth overages**: $15 per 100 GB beyond included plan bandwidth (effective Aug 1, 2025). ([Render][4])

**Bottom line for your starter**: Hobby workspace ($0) + one **Starter** web service ($7) + **Basic‑256MB** Postgres ($6) ≈ **$13/mo**, plus any bandwidth overage.

---

## 2) I already own positivesumtechnologies.com. Will I use this?

Yes. Add it to your Render service as a **custom domain**. Render manages TLS certs and auto‑redirects HTTP→HTTPS.

**Steps:**

1. In your service → **Settings → Custom Domains** → add `positivesumtechnologies.com` and `www.positivesumtechnologies.com`.
2. Update DNS at your registrar per Render’s instructions; then click **Verify**. (Remove old AAAA records; Render uses IPv4.) ([Render][5])

---

## 3) What is Alembic and why is it useful?

**Alembic** is the standard migration tool for SQLAlchemy. It turns schema changes into versioned migration scripts so you can upgrade/downgrade your database safely across environments. Use it as soon as you add real tables. ([alembic.sqlalchemy.org][6])

Minimal flow:

```
pip install alembic
alembic init migrations
# edit alembic.ini and env.py to point at DATABASE_URL
alembic revision -m "create users" --autogenerate
alembic upgrade head
```

Autogenerate compares your SQLAlchemy models to the DB and proposes diffs you can review before applying. ([alembic.sqlalchemy.org][7])

---

## 4) What is Sentry, and how does it compare to alternatives?

**Sentry** is app monitoring focused on **error tracking** (plus tracing, session replay, uptime, cron monitoring). It shows stack traces, links errors to releases/commits, and notifies you. For a solo/early project, it’s the fastest way to see and fix crashes. Plans: **Developer (free)**, **Team ($26/mo)**, **Business ($80/mo)**, with included quotas and usage add‑ons. ([Sentry][8])

**Alternatives and when they fit:**

* **Rollbar** – also error tracking; comparable features; free tier and paid tiers (e.g., Essentials, Advanced). If you want a narrower, error‑only tool, compare pricing/UX. ([Rollbar][9])
* **Bugsnag** – error + performance monitoring; free starter and paid usage tiers. Good multi‑platform support. ([bugsnag.com][10])
* **Datadog** – full observability suite (infra, APM, logs, synthetics). Powerful but more to learn and typically higher cost as you scale. ([Datadog][11])

Note: Sentry’s core SaaS offers a generous free tier; their self‑hosted components use the **Functional Source License (FSL)** (SDKs remain permissively licensed). For you, SaaS Sentry is simplest. ([Sentry][12])

---

## 5) Can I use GitHub to store my secrets?

**Yes, but narrowly.** Use **GitHub Actions Secrets** (and **Environments** with protection rules) for CI/CD‑only items like a **Render Deploy Hook URL** or a **Render API key**. Keep **runtime secrets** (DB URL, Sentry DSN) in **Render’s environment variables** so the app receives them at runtime. ([GitHub Docs][13])

Security notes:

* Prefer **“After CI Checks Pass”** in Render or trigger via **Deploy Hook** from CI (store the hook URL as a GitHub secret). ([Render][2])
* Follow GitHub’s **Actions security hardening** guidance. Recent supply‑chain incidents have stolen tokens from compromised workflows—keep third‑party actions pinned and minimal. ([GitHub Docs][14])
* When authenticating to cloud providers, **OIDC** beats long‑lived secrets. (You won’t need cloud creds for basic Render, but remember this when you add AWS/GCP/Azure.) ([GitHub Docs][15])

---

## 6) Local dev setup and the fastest idea→production loop

**Local setup:**

```
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./dev.db   # or point to local Postgres
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
pytest -q
```

If you want Postgres locally:

```
docker run --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/postgres
```

**Fast loop for new features:**

1. `git switch -c feat/something`
2. Build the feature; run `pytest -q`.
3. Push branch; open a PR.
4. Enable **Render Service Previews** to get an **ephemeral deploy per PR** (auto‑updated on every commit; auto‑destroyed when merged). ([Render][16])
5. Merge to `main`. Set your service to **Auto‑deploy After CI Checks Pass** so production updates as soon as CI is green. ([Render][2])

That gives you: local hot‑reload → PR preview URL for review → automatic prod deploy once tests pass.

---

## 7) Knowing this is for your **Columbia Brain** project—does the starter change?

A bit of structure helps, but your **core app stays the same**. Add these Render building blocks as you grow:

* **Background Worker** (queue ingestion, scrapers, enrichers) + **Key Value** (Redis‑compatible) for queues/caching. ([Render][17])
* **Cron Jobs** for scheduled pulls (e.g., nightly business listings refresh, event aggregation). ([Render][18])
* **Postgres** as the system of record. Start simple with one schema; introduce Alembic migrations from day one.
* Keep the FastAPI web service for the user‑facing site and APIs; add a separate admin UI later.

That layout scales without changing frameworks and plays well with Render’s service types.

---

## 8) How do I make this **secure from the start**?

**Practical baseline (day 1):**

* **Secrets**: never commit them; store runtime secrets in **Render env vars**. Rotate on role changes. ([Render][19])
* **HTTPS**: Render handles TLS and HTTP→HTTPS. Add **HSTS** and basic security headers at the app layer. ([Render][5])
* **Host header protection**: only allow your domains.
* **CSP**: start strict (`default-src 'self'`) and expand as needed.
* **Auth later?** Use HTTP‑only, Secure cookies; SameSite=Lax.
* **Keep an eye on OWASP**: use the **Top 10** and **ASVS** as checklists. ([OWASP][20])

Add this to your FastAPI app (no comments, safe defaults):

```python
from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=[
    "positivesumtechnologies.com",
    "www.positivesumtechnologies.com",
    "*.onrender.com"
])

@app.middleware("http")
async def secure_headers(request, call_next):
    resp = await call_next(request)
    resp.headers["Strict-Transport-Security"] = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
    resp.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    resp.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    resp.headers["Referrer-Policy"] = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    resp.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "default-src 'self'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'"
    return resp
```

References for these headers and middleware patterns: OWASP secure headers and Starlette docs. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][21])

For uptime and resilience: enable a `/healthz`, keep one small **Starter** instance at first; when usage grows, run multiple instances and health checks, and set up an **external uptime probe**. ([Render][22])

---

## 9) How can I monitor traffic to my website?

Think in three layers:

1. **Uptime**: a simple external checker (Better Stack, UptimeRobot, HeyOnCall). Render recommends external probes as part of uptime best practices. ([Render][22])
2. **Server‑side logs/metrics**: Render’s dashboard shows logs and **service metrics**; you can also stream OpenTelemetry metrics to third‑party observability tools if you want. ([Render][23])
3. **Privacy‑friendly analytics**:

   * **Plausible** (hosted SaaS or self‑hosted CE). Minimal script, GDPR‑friendly. ([Plausible Analytics][24])
   * **PostHog** if you want product analytics, funnels, session replay later; usage‑based pricing with generous free tiers. ([PostHog][25])

---

## First 60 minutes checklist (tailored to you)

1. Push the provided FastAPI starter to GitHub, wire it up in Render (web service + Basic‑256MB Postgres). ([Render][26])
2. Enable **Auto‑deploy After CI Checks Pass**; keep CI as in the sample `ci.yml`. ([Render][2])
3. Add your domain in Render; update DNS; verify; test `https://positivesumtechnologies.com`. ([Render][5])
4. Add the **security middleware** snippet above.
5. Add **Alembic** and run an empty migration (`alembic revision -m "base" --autogenerate; alembic upgrade head`). ([alembic.sqlalchemy.org][7])
6. Create a Sentry project; add the DSN as a **Render env var**; install `sentry-sdk` and initialize in `main.py`. Start on the free plan. ([Sentry][8])
7. Turn on **Render Service Previews** so every PR gets a live URL. ([Render][16])

If you want, I can produce a clean repo structure with Alembic wired, the security headers in place, Sentry initialization, and a Plausible embed ready to toggle, along with Render settings callouts.

Does the use of Alembic assume that I'm doing database work locally using SQLAlchemy, and that needs to be migrated (translated) to PostgreSQL once it gets pushed to the web server?

What are the advantages to using Postgres locally? What would be the alternatives?

What is an ephemeral deploy on Render Service Previews?

What is HSTS?

What is CSP?

Expand on these points please:

```
Auth later? Use HTTP‑only, Secure cookies; SameSite=Lax.

Keep an eye on OWASP: use the Top 10 and ASVS as checklists.
```

Great questions. I’ll go point‑by‑point, in plain English, and add a few “do this next” steps.

## What’s Uvicorn?

**Short answer:** It’s the ultra‑fast HTTP/WebSocket server that runs your FastAPI app. Think “engine + waiter”: it speaks HTTP to the outside world and hands each request to your Python code using the ASGI interface. You’ll start it with a command like `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`. ([uvicorn.org][1])

## How do TLS certificates work?

**Idea:** A browser only trusts a site if it can validate a **chain of trust** from your site’s cert → an intermediate cert → a root Certificate Authority (CA) already trusted by the browser. CAs issue these certs after you prove you control the domain (via an automated ACME challenge like HTTP‑01 or DNS‑01). Once validated, the browser and server do a **TLS handshake** to agree on keys and ciphers and then encrypt traffic. ([DigiCert Knowledge Base][2])

**On Render:** You don’t manage any of this. Render auto‑issues and renews certs for your custom domains using Let’s Encrypt and Google Trust Services, and it auto‑redirects HTTP→HTTPS. ([Render][3])

---

## What are AAAA records?

They’re DNS records that map a name to an **IPv6** address, analogous to A records (IPv4). Render’s custom domains are IPv4‑only today; their docs say to **remove AAAA records** when pointing your domain to Render so traffic doesn’t go to a non‑existent IPv6 endpoint. ([Cloudflare][4])

---

## Does using Alembic assume I’m coding SQLAlchemy locally and “migrating to Postgres” on deploy?

Not exactly. **Alembic is version control for your database schema.** You describe models (SQLAlchemy) and Alembic generates migration scripts that apply those changes to **whatever database** your `DATABASE_URL` points at (dev, staging, prod). It’s not a translator; it just applies the same change set everywhere. Autogenerate inspects your models vs. the DB and proposes a diff you can edit and then apply with `alembic upgrade head`. ([Alembic][5])

**Tip:** Cross‑dialect development (SQLite in dev, Postgres in prod) can cause surprises (types, constraints, JSON, concurrency). Prefer Postgres locally to match prod.

---

## Advantages of using Postgres locally (and alternatives)

* **Postgres locally (recommended):** Max **parity** with prod so migrations and queries behave the same. Full SQL, JSONB, constraints, indexes, and realistic performance characteristics. Run via Docker or a local install. ([PostgreSQL][6])
* **SQLite:** Zero setup; great for unit tests and simple prototypes. But weaker concurrency, different SQL features, and autogenerate diffs can mislead you vs. Postgres.
* **Remote dev DB:** You can point dev to a small managed Postgres (Render Basic‑256MB is cheap) if you don’t want Docker locally. ([Render][7])

---

## What is an ephemeral deploy on Render Service Previews?

It’s a **temporary, isolated copy of your app** created automatically for each pull request. You get a unique URL to review changes; it updates on each commit and is cleaned up when the PR closes/merges. It lets you click‑test features before they hit production. ([Render][8])

---

## What is HSTS?

**HTTP Strict‑Transport‑Security** is a response header that tells browsers “only use HTTPS for this host for the next N seconds.” After a browser sees it once, it will auto‑upgrade future requests and refuse to proceed on bad certs. Common value: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` once you’re all‑HTTPS. ([MDN Web Docs][9])

---

## What is CSP?

**Content‑Security‑Policy** is an allowlist for what your pages may load or execute. Example: `default-src 'self'` blocks unexpected scripts and mitigates XSS by default. Start strict and only open what you need (e.g., if you self‑host htmx under `/static`, `script-src 'self'` is enough). ([MDN Web Docs][10])

---

## Expanding the “auth later” and “OWASP” notes

### Cookies for session auth (sane defaults)

* **HttpOnly**: not readable by JS, shields from XSS‑based theft.
* **Secure**: only sent over HTTPS.
* **SameSite**: start with `Lax` to block most cross‑site sends while keeping normal navigation working. Use `None; Secure` only if you truly need cross‑site flows (embedded apps, multi‑domain frontends). ([MDN Web Docs][11])

Minimal FastAPI snippet to set a session cookie:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login")
def login(response: Response):
    response.set_cookie(
        "session", "opaque-or-signed-value",
        httponly=True, secure=True, samesite="lax", path="/"
    )
    return {"ok": True}
```

**CSRF**: With cookie‑based auth, add CSRF tokens for **state‑changing** requests (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE). Use the synchronizer token pattern (store server‑side) or double‑submit pattern (cookie + header) for APIs; frameworks often provide helpers. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][12])

### OWASP as your lightweight checklist

* **Top 10**: Awareness list of the most common classes of web vulns (Broken Access Control, Injection, Security Misconfig, etc.). Keep it nearby when reviewing features. ([OWASP][13])
* **ASVS**: A deeper **requirements catalog** for web app security. Use **ASVS v5.0** as a target (“Level 1 to start”), mapping items to issues/tasks. ([OWASP][14])

---

## Security from day zero (practical)

Add strict headers and host protection:

```python
from starlette.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=[
    "positivesumtechnologies.com", "www.positivesumtechnologies.com", "*.onrender.com"
])

@app.middleware("http")
async def secure_headers(request, call_next):
    r = await call_next(request)
    r.headers["Strict-Transport-Security"] = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
    r.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    r.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    r.headers["Referrer-Policy"] = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    r.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "default-src 'self'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; script-src 'self'"
    return r
```

`TrustedHostMiddleware` blocks host‑header abuse; these headers align with OWASP secure‑headers guidance. If you load any third‑party scripts, add them to `script-src` or self‑host them. ([starlette.io][15])

## How to get started with Render (Step‑by‑step)

1. **Sign up and connect GitHub.** In Render, click **New → Web Service**, choose your repo/branch. Set build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`; start: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`. Turn on **Auto‑deploy After CI Checks Pass** so production only updates when GitHub Actions is green. ([Render][16])
2. **Add Postgres.** **New → Postgres**, pick the smallest paid plan for stability. Copy the internal `DATABASE_URL` into your web service env vars. ([Render][17])
3. **Custom domain.** In **Settings → Custom Domains**, add `positivesumtechnologies.com` and `www`. At your registrar, add the DNS records Render shows. Remove any AAAA records per their docs. Wait for verify; HTTPS is automatic. ([Render][18])
4. **Service Previews.** Enable previews so each PR spins up an isolated URL. Merge to main to deploy to production. ([Render][8])
5. **Deploy hooks (optional).** If you prefer CI to trigger deploys explicitly after tests, use the **Deploy Hook URL** from your service settings and `curl` it in a `deploy.yml` job. ([Render][19])

---

## A few practical gotchas and choices

* **Uvicorn alone vs Gunicorn+Uvicorn workers:** For your first site, `uvicorn` alone is fine. If you need more concurrency and process management later, add multiple workers (either `uvicorn --workers N` or Gunicorn with uvicorn workers). ([FastAPI][20])
* **CSP + scripts:** If you started with `<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx...">`, a strict `script-src 'self'` will block it. Either self‑host `htmx.min.js` under `/static` or add that origin explicitly to `script-src`. ([MDN Web Docs][10])
* **IPv6:** Because Render custom domains don’t use AAAA yet, removing IPv6 records avoids odd routing for some clients. ([Render][21])

---

## Quick mental map tying it all together

* **Uvicorn** runs your FastAPI app.
* **Render** builds and runs it, gives you **TLS** automatically, and lets you use your **custom domain**.
* **Alembic** versions your schema so dev/stage/prod move together.
* **Service Previews** spin up throwaway environments for each PR.
* **Security**: HSTS forces HTTPS; **CSP** limits what can run; cookies are `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`; host header is locked down.
* **Postgres** locally mirrors prod; migrations behave the same.

If you want, I’ll generate your repo’s exact environment file list (Render env vars, GitHub secrets, local `.env.example`), plus a CSP preset that matches the libraries you choose.
